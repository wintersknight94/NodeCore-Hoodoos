# NodeCore-Hoodoos

- 'Hoodoos', also called 'tent rocks', 'earth pyramids', and (my favorite) 'fairy chimneys', are irregular spires of rock formed by erosion.
- They are typically found in sedimentary and volcanic rock formations and are often affected by the varying erosion patterns of alternating hard and soft rock layers.
- Due to the varying composition of rock layers, they range greatly in size, shape, and height, and are often banded by various colorations.
- Some 'Tent Rocks' in Armenia were carved out and used/lived in at one point.
